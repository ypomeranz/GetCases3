"""Detect citations to the United States Statutes at Large ("<vol> Stat.
<page>", e.g. "88 Stat. 1932") and link them to the free official scan.

GovInfo has digitized the **complete** Statutes at Large and exposes a link
service that resolves a volume/page straight to the PDF, opened to the cited
page:

    https://www.govinfo.gov/link/statute/<volume>/<page>
        → https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-<v>/pdf/STATUTE-<v>-Pg<p>.pdf#page=N

Coverage runs from volume 1 (1789) up to the most recent published volume; a
citation outside that range (a not-yet-published recent volume) yields no link
rather than a dead one.  This is link-out only — the GUI opens the URL with a
``("browse", url)`` action — so there is no HTML parser here.
