"""Extract single opinions from US Reports volume PDFs, fetching the volumes
from the Supreme Court's website on first use.

The official per-opinion scans stop at vol 542 (LOC CDN) / vol 583 (GovInfo).
For later volumes the Supreme Court publishes whole bound volumes (vols
502-587 today) and preliminary prints (588+, split in two halves, each with
its own roman-numbered front matter) at predictable URLs:

  https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/boundvolumes/584BV.pdf
  https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/preliminaryprint/592US2PP.pdf
                                    (suffix varies: _final / _web / bare)

Given a citation like "584 U.S. 79" this module downloads the volume into
the "US Reports" folder next to this module — once; every later citation
into that volume reuses the saved file — then carves the cited opinion out
of it and caches that as a standalone PDF.  Only volumes past GovInfo's
per-opinion coverage (584+) are ever fetched; volumes already sitting in
the folder (hand-downloaded) are used as-is, no network involved.

How the carving works — all of these PDFs carry proper page *labels*
("III", "XI", "1", "29", …), so the printed reporter page maps straight to
a PDF index with no text scanning.  Where an opinion *ends* is read from
the running heads, which are rigidly structured:

  opinion first page   "28 OCTOBER TERM, 2017"  /  "OCTOBER TERM, 2017 79"
  interior recto       "Cite as: 584 U. S. 28 (2018) 29"   (28 = opinion start)
  interior verso       "30 AYESTAS v. DAVIS"
  orders section       "902 OCTOBER TERM, 2018"  /  "ORDERS 903"  (every page)

So: start at the cited page and scan forward; the opinion ends just before
the first page whose head says OCTOBER TERM (a new opinion's first page),
ORDERS, a "Cite as:" start page other than ours, a new section title, or a
gap in the printed page numbers (the label "runs" separate the opinions,
orders, in-chambers and rules-amendment sections).  A citation into the
orders section therefore extracts that single page — orders share pages and
their running heads carry no per-order boundary — while argued opinions and
per curiams come out whole (syllabus through last dissent).

Headless (no tkinter); requires pypdfium2.  Run
``python -X utf8 us_reports_pdf.py 584 79`` to test an extraction.
