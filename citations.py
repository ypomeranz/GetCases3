"""Citation detection shared by the opinion reader and the brief viewer.

This module is deliberately free of any ``tkinter`` dependency so the citation
logic can be unit-tested headlessly (``python3 citations.py``) and reused by the
"Open Brief…" feature, which renders a user's brief and highlights every
citation it can resolve.

It owns the reporter-citation regexes (case cites, short forms, ``Id.``) that
used to live in ``courtlistener_gui`` and adds :func:`detect_links`, which scans
a whole document and returns the clickable spans — case citations plus every
statute/regulation/rule/constitution source the app already knows how to open.

The per-source modules (``us_code``, ``ecfr``, ``fed_rules``, ``constitution``,
``state_statutes``, ``statutes_at_large``, ``federal_register``) each expose
their own citation parser; :func:`detect_links` simply runs them all over the
text and reconciles overlaps the same way the opinion reader does.
